# Prometheus + Grafana Monitoring Stack  


Prometheus is a system monitoring application that polls client systems for key metrics. Each client node must use an exporter to collect and expose the requested data. Prometheus is most effective when used together with the Grafana visualization tool. Grafana imports the metrics from Prometheus and presents them using an intuitive dashboard structure.

To integrate the components, download and install Prometheus on a central server and configure Prometheus as a service. Install the Prometheus Node Exporter on each client to collect the data and configure Prometheus to poll the clients. Install Grafana on the same server as Prometheus and configure Prometheus as a data source. Finally, import a dashboard to display the metrics from the client.
